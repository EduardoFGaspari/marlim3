Mathematical foundations of the Marlim3 transient drift-flux model.

Marlim3 solves a one-dimensional, three-phase (gas–liquid–liquid) drift-flux system coupled to an energy equation and a finite-volume discretization on a staggered grid. These pages document the governing equations and the numerical schemes implemented in the solver.
